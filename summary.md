In designing a database for a career planning. Our first order of business was 
to create a ER diagram. This help us map out what are the important entities
and how they are related. From there we reduced the diagram into a relational 
schema. This gave us a structure to how the tables would be set up and how
what types of data would be put in them. Using our relational schema we 
were able write the queries desired. 

In phase 2 of the project, we turned in a Java TUI to run our queries. We
completely rewrote our TUI and made a GUI out of it. We implemented a system to
use a combobox that runs our queries in the program, retrieves the information
from the database, and creates a table based on the retrieved information.
After we created that part of the program, designed custom queries to create
the ability to find jobs based on a set of skills and find an employee based on
a job's required skills. These two queries were implemented in "Add Employee"
and "Find Job" sections of the GUI. We also added a selection for a company to
add an employee to the database.
