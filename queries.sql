-- “quickest” solution for this worker. Show the course, section information and the completion date.
-- 11. Find the cheapest course to make up one’s skill gap by showing the course to take and the cost (of the section
-- price).
-- 12. If query #9 returns nothing, then find the course sets that their combination covers all the missing knowledge/
-- skills for a person to pursue a specific job. The considered course sets will not include more than three courses. If multiple course sets are found, list the course sets (with their course IDs) in the order of the ascending order of the course sets’ total costs.
-- 13. List all the job categories that a person is qualified for.
-- 14. Find the job with the highest pay rate for a person according to his/her skill qualification.
-- 15. List all the names along with the emails of the persons who are qualified for a job.
-- 16. When a company cannot find any qualified person for a job, a secondary solution is to find a person who is almost
-- qualified to the job. Make a “missing-one” list that lists people who miss only one skill for a specified job.
-- 17. List the skillID and the number of people in the missing-one list for a given job code in the ascending order of the
-- people counts.
-- 18. Suppose there is a new job that has nobody qualified. List the persons who miss the least number of skills and
-- report the “least number”.
-- 19. For a specified job category and a given small number k, make a “missing-k” list that lists the people’s IDs and
-- the number of missing skills for the people who miss only up to k skills in the ascending order of missing skills.
-- 20. Given a job category code and its corresponding missing-k list specified in Question 19. Find every skill that is
-- needed by at least one person in the given missing-k list. List each skillID and the number of people who need it
-- in the descending order of the people counts.
-- 21. In a local or national crisis, we need to find all the people who once held a job of the special job category
-- identifier.
-- 22. Find all the unemployed people who once held a job of the given job identifier.
-- 23. Find out the biggest employer in terms of number of employees or the total amount of salaries and wages paid to
-- employees.
-- 24. Find out the job distribution among business sectors; find out the biggest sector in terms of number of employees
-- or the total amount of salaries and wages paid to employees.
-- 25. Find out the ratio between the people whose earnings increase and those whose earning decrease; find the average
-- rate of earning improvement for the workers in a specific business sector.
-- 26. Find the leaf-node job categories that have the most openings due to lack of qualified workers. If there are many
-- opening jobs of a job category but at the same time there are many qualified jobless people. Then training cannot help fill up this type of job. What we want to find is such a job category that has the largest difference between vacancies (the unfilled jobs of this category) and the number of jobless people who are qualified for the jobs of this category.
-- 27. Find the courses that can help most jobless people find a job by training them toward the jobs of this category that have the most openings due to lack of qualified workers.
-- 28. List all the courses, directly or indirectly required, that a person has to take in order to be qualified for a job of the given category, according to his/her skills possessed and courses taken.
