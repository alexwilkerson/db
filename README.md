# Workforce Management and Career Planning System

Information system that can help optimize training programs, job assistance
services, career planning, and company recruitment. 

## Development Tasks

1. [x] Make an E-R diagram showing your data model. In the diagram, show the
   important attributes of each entity. For every relationship, show the
   cardinality and the participation status, as well as any important
   attributes associated with the relationship. Be sure to indicate the primary
   key of each strong entity. Note, this is a data-model E-R diagram, not a
   detailed relation schema diagram for implementation. I will accept hand-draw
   diagrams. Feel free to discuss your E-R diagram in class or during my office
   hours.

2. [x] Reduce the data-model E-R diagram to the database relations schema. Draw
   a relation-schema diagram for your implementation.

3. [ ] Enumerate the concerned functional dependencies (to be learned in
   Chapter 8) in your system.

4. [ ] Revise the database schema design by producing a lossless-join 3NF
   schema that preserves functional dependencies (to be learned in Chapter 8).


5. [ ] Populate the tables with adequate data such that all the questions can
   be demonstrated. Be sure to write your INSERT statements in SQL scripts. You
   are also required to write a SQL script that cleans up everything in the
   database; this will be a good exercise to realize the dependencies enforced
   by foreign key references. In your development process, you must re-populate
   your database after cleaning up it for multiple times.

    * [ ] populate the tables with adequate data 
    * [x] script that populate the database
    * [x] script cleans up the database 

6. [ ] Write the SQL statements that carry out the 26 queries listed above, or
   28 for the graduate students. Write a user interface in Java to drive each
   of these queries with JDBC. A graphical interface (GUI) will be appreciated
   but not necessary.

    Required:

    - [x] 1  [x] 2  [x] 3  [x] 4  [x] 5
    - [x] 6  [x] 7  [x] 8  [x] 9  [x] 10
    - [x] 11 [ ] 12 [x] 13 [x] 14 [x] 15
    - [x] 16 [x] 17 [x] 18 [x] 19 [x] 20
    - [x] 21 [x] 22 [x] 23 [x] 24 [ ] 25
    - [ ] 26 

    Bonus:

    * [ ] 27 [ ] 28 


7. [ ] Design and implement some of the Java classes such as Course,
   Job_Category, Job, and Person with the JDBC technique. These Java classes
   should support creation (such as creating a course, a job category, or a
   job) and deletion (such as removing a job or setting a course inactive.)
   Note, this task carries relative light weight of this project; do not spend
   too much time on too many “classes”.

8. [ ] Design and implement the database application that manages business
   processes. Write application programs to support business processes such as
   the following: 
    a) A company accepts a new employee;
    b) A person’s job hunting;
    c) A company finds the right people for a job with training;

    Implement these features:

    * [x] Screen that runs above queries
    * [ ] Screen that adds an person to a company
    * [x] Screen that finds company's given skills 
    * [ ] Screen that finds persons given skills 

## Presentation

Every group must sign up for an hour-long project inspection with me in the
week of November 27. At least two test cases should be prepared and documented
for queries 8 through 28, as well as for services (a) through (c) specified in
Development Task (8). Each test case must include the prepared input
data/setting and a specification of the expected output/results. Early
submission and demonstration of project earn bonus points.


Test Cases:

- [ ] 8  [ ] 9  [ ] 10
- [ ] 11 [ ] 12 [ ] 13 [ ] 14 [ ] 15
- [ ] 16 [ ] 17 [ ] 18 [ ] 19 [ ] 20
- [ ] 21 [ ] 22 [ ] 23 [ ] 24 [ ] 25
- [ ] 26 [ ] 27 [ ] 28
